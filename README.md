 About This Project

This project utilizes TensorFlow Playground to demonstrate a neural network's learning process on a Gaussian dataset with two features. Key configurations include:

- Dataset: Gaussian with 2 features
- Learning Rate: 0.03
- Activation Function: Sigmoid
- Regularization: L2 with a rate of 0.03
- Problem Type: Classification
- Network Architecture: 
  - 1 Input Layer with 2 features
  - 6 Hidden Layers
  - 1 Output Layer for binary classification

This setup provides a hands-on visualization of how neural networks can be trained for classification tasks, showcasing the impact of various parameters on the network's performance.
